# Career

My name is Melchor Dominguez. I graduated from Western Carolina University in 2019 with majors in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science with an Economics minor. I have 11 months of professional experience as a Software Developer with my most recent employer - Quoin Inc. At the moment, I still cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years or even what my big career goal is. Life has changed rapidly - I don't have enough professional experience to be certain about things. However, I have always been fascinated by turning new stones, learning, and numbers. I am open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and extremely meticulous. The most important thing to me is achieving high-quality work. I still have learning and new experiences to soak up, so in the meantime, my short term goal is to be a sponge..

# Hobbies

I like to keep busy during my free time. Like most people in my generation, I enjoy working out and playing video games. I also enjoy cooking and playing music. In my younger days - I played Trombone, Baritone, and Piano. Since then, I have stuck firmly to the guitar and trying to practice as often as I can. Lastly, I have recently taken up trading stocks and find myself looking for new trades daily.
